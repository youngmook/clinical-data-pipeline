# clinical-data-pipeline

Foundational pipeline for collecting, normalizing, and linking
clinical compound data from **PubChem** and **ClinicalTrials.gov (v2 API)**.

## Purpose
This repository provides a research-grade data pipeline that:
- Retrieves compound identifiers and metadata from PubChem
- Queries clinical trial data from ClinicalTrials.gov
- Links compounds to trials using normalized identifiers and synonyms
- Exports analysis-ready datasets (CSV / Parquet)

This repository serves as a **foundational data integration pipeline**
within the magicai-labs ecosystem.

## Status
🚧 Initial development (MVP pipeline in progress)
